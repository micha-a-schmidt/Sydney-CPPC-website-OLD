### Research interests
Archil’s research interests span a range of longstanding problems in particle theory and phenomenology, gravity and cosmology. Currently he is focussed on the development of the scale invariant paradigm for particle physics and cosmology, on studies of gravitational waves, nonperturbative electroweak phenomena and implications of cosmological phase transitions.
